Baseball Factories<br>
<br>
This project started out as me wondering where the world's baseball players were coming from. I want to note that this doesn't account for players who identify as dual nationalities. This is with me wondering where the world's baseball players came, just those players from countries where they hold citizenship.<br><br>
